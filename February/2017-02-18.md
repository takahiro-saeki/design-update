##paper
[paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper)：  
paper is a one of the simplest design of web. It seems to be not complicated of design totally. I want to refer to this design as a self-project in the future.  
In particular, Apps Ui is quite good and good interface.

##Authentic Weather
[Authentic Weather](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7196565/Authentic-Weather)：  
Authentic Weather is really simeple design. I seem that it's quite simple. People who have good experience of design think to it too simple probably, I think it's quite good design. Maybe, I'd love to see too simple design. Because of this. Nowadays, I seem that UI and web design are getting simple. We don't need complicated UI and lots of information on apps and web pages. We might adapt too simple design.  

##mailchimp
[mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)：  
mailchimp is web site. It's good pastel color and to be used dot design. In response to scroll, `sign up free` button
is change whether hide or show. Showing and hiding animation is also good. Also, It has own blog in this site. It's design is also simple and good. I wonder if I think it is made by wordpress probably.  

##Tilt Brush
[Tilt Brush](https://www.tiltbrush.com/)：  
Tilt Brush is service by google. The most remarkable thing is sidebar. According to background color, sidebar's design is changing. And it has been being used gradation color is also good. Definitely, it's used material design but it includes greatful gradation pattern. It's not too simple but It's not too gorgeous.
