I'd love to watch this design because it's quite organizing design. Good color balance, adjusting padding and also margin size.  
If we adapt to use White-background-color, it's difficult to adjust color balance. White color makes us feel reliable but it makes us feel boring sometimes.
I wanna refer to this design if have a opportunity to make design or to adjust some design.

This design is quite impressive. In particular, Gradation balance is good. I'm not good at adjusting gradation color, In particular, gradation of background color. However, This design is quite good adjustment. I remembered about mobile app which is Rizap. I wonder if Rizap's app design is similar between this design and that one.  

##outline

outline is css framework which be able to make simple design. This might not be related design, but it's good atmosphere. It seemed to be easy to use. Also, We might use easily.
