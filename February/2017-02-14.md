This is also CSS framework which can use lots of component or option. This CSS framework is using SASS, gulp and jQuery internally. I hate to use jQuery but So many developer (In particular, web-designer) use it. It make us feel comfortable to make app and design. I think that we've got to make an effort, also had better make it easy to implement. It might help you if use this one.

This is emundyu's portfolio. I was impressive when clicked menu button. It's good animation. I thought that it's using like a SPA internally. Design is quite simple and good responsive design.
