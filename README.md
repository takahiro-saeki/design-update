#Design Trend
This is a repository which catches up with trend of design.  

##Why Did I adapt to make this repository?  
I'm front-end developer and usually keep up with current trend of front-end such as framework, around library, architecture, and so on. Because of this, I don't usually keep up with learning trend of design.
However, So many front-end developer are related to design because we usually make portion of HTML and CSS.
That's why I wanna learn design. This is my motivation.

##Work progress
In the future, I'm gonna organize this repository such as ...
- Everyone can see my article on GitHub as a web page, which means I will adapt to use static page generator such as Jekyll.
- Change directory hierarchie.
- and more...
